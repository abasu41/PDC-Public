             PDC is a open access resource, meaning there are no restrictions to access the data. To ensure HIPAA compliance, PDC does not collect protected health information (PHI) and data submitters must ensure data have been de-identified before submission.

              <p>
                Data can be submitted up to a year before the release, but PDC will only begin processing after the submitting authors asked us to prioritize their data for release.
                <strong style="font-weight: bolder;"><i>It takes approximately six to eight weeks to process the data for public release. To begin processing, the data should be completely uploaded and validated as per PDC data submission requirements.</i></strong>
                Please note that gathering data and metadata as per the PDC submission requirements may take some time. To avoid delays, you should plan early even if the manuscript is still being prepared. Any data changes made during the processing period may result in delays because of the need to resubmit and reprocess the data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a dataset is fully processed and marked for release, no further changes are possible except for some minor modifications on a case-by-case basis. However, authors may choose to delay the release until revisions have been made or request not to be released.
              </p>
              <p>
                PDC releases the data when requested by the authors, either when the corresponding paper is published, or on a particular date. Once a release is requested, the dataset will be added to the closest scheduled release, but we make every effort to release as close as possible to the date requested. Data will normally be available on the PDC portal after business hours on the release date.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the citation details of the publication are not available at the release time, they will be added later. It is the responsibility of the authors to notify us of the citation details. Any revision of the data following the release will be managed under the PDC versioning process. Contact PDCHelpDesk@mail.nih.gov and see the FAQ <a href="/pdc/faq/Study_Version">'What is a study version?'</a> for more details.

                    <p>The submission process involves the following major activities,</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Creating an <b>instrument</b> to upload raw data</li>
                      <li>Create a <b>project</b> under which to group the raw data into a <b>Study</b> that was generated using a specific experimental <b>protocol</b></li>
                      <li>Upload biospecimen and clinical metadata for the samples used in the Studies</li>

                        <li><b>Create an instrument:</b><br><br><p>An instrument is a representation of the mass spectrometer from your lab. Go to create, click instrument, and enter the relevant information about the mass spectrometer used to collect the data. If you are a program member, you will receive an email once approved by the PDC admin or the program lead (PI).</p><br><br>

                        <br>
                        <p>Note: You must be added as an assigned instrument operator to upload data to an instrument unless you are the creator of that instrument.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Upload raw files:</b><br><br><p>Click upload, and in the dialog requesting information, select the instrument you previously created. You can upload directly from your local computer or from the cloud (AWS S3 is supported) if your files are on S3 already.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Note: The PDC Workspace accepts files with the “.raw”, “.d”; “.wiff”; “.wiff.scan”; “.wiff.mtd”; “.dat”; “.mis”. These files are produced directly on the mass spectrometer acquisition computer and are typically in proprietary formats.</p>
                            <p>Tip: You may create a separate instrument for each study that you would like to create, even if all those files are generated from the same mass spectrometer. This is not required, but may help to organize and separate your files, facilitating study creation.</p>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><b>Create a Project:</b><br><br>
                            <p><b>Before you can create a Study or add your Protocol, you first need to create a Project.</b></p>
                            <p>Click Create->Project to open the wizard. Next, give your Project a name, select a Program and area of Research. You may also add collaborators to your project using the Sharing tab.</p><br><br>

                            <p> To create the study, click Create->Study to launch the wizard. In the wizard, for steps requiring you to enter data in tabular form for the sample/aliquot to file mapping, you may copy and paste from the Experimental Run Metadata sheet from the PDC submission template you prepared.
