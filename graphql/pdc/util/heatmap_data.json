        "study_description": "<p>Our study details the stepwise evolution of gilteritinib resistance in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Early resistance is mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, which protects residual leukemia cells. Over time, leukemia cells evolve intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, or late resistance. We mechanistically define both early and late resistance by integrating whole-exome sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, metabolomics, proteomics, and pharmacologic approaches. Early resistant cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, grow more slowly, and are dependent upon Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Late resistant cells are characterized by expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones and continued metabolic reprogramming. Our model closely mirrors the timing and mutations of AML patients treated with gilteritinib. Pharmacological inhibition of AURKB resensitizes both early resistant cell cultures and primary leukemia cells from gilteritinib-treated AML patients. These findings support a combinatorial strategy to target early resistant AML cells with AURKB inhibitors and gilteritinib before the expansion of pre-existing resistance mutations occurs.</p><p>Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Data Analysis is provided below for:<br>Gilteritinib Resistance<br>Quizartinib Resistance<br>Gilteritinib TimeCourse</p><p>Peptide Spectrum Matches (PSMs) and Summary Reports available are from the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP).</p><p>The whole exome sequencing (WES) datasets generated during this study are available at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA666471/' target='_blank'>PRJNA666471</a>).<br>\nCRISPR-Cas9 datasets generated during this study are available at NCBI GEO (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158717' target='_blank'>GSE158717</a>).<br>\nRNA-Sequencing data generated during this study is available at NCBI GEO (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE168583' target='_blank'>GSE168583</a>).</p>",

Targeted quantitation of two peptides can predict antigen processing and presentation machinery (APM) activity and may inform patient selection for immunotherapy. Association analysis between MYC activity and metformin treatment in both tumors and cell lines suggests a potential role for metformin treatment in non-diabetic patients with elevated MYC activity. PIK3R1 in-frame indels are associated with elevated AKT phosphorylation and increased sensitivity to AKT inhibitors. CTNNB1 hotspot mutations are concentrated near phosphorylation sites mediating pS45 induced degradation of &#946;-catenin, which may render Wnt/FZD antagonists ineffective. Deep learning accurately predicts EC subtypes and mutations from histopathology images, which may be useful for rapid diagnosis. Overall, this study identified molecular and imaging markers that can be further investigated to guide patient stratification for improved precision treatment of EC.</p>",

        "study_description": "<p>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) affects 20,000 patients in the US annually with a five-year survival rate of approximately 25%. One reason for the low survival rate is the high prevalence of clonal evolution that gives rise to heterogeneous sub-populations of leukemic cells with diverse mutation spectra, which eventually leads to disease relapse. This genetic heterogeneity drives the activation of complex signaling pathways that is reflected at the protein level. This diversity makes it difficult to treat AML with targeted therapy, requiring custom patient treatment protocols tailored to each individual\u2019s leukemia. Toward this end, the Beat AML research program prospectively collected genomic and transcriptomic data from over 1000 AML patients and carried out ex vivo drug sensitivity assays to identify genomic signatures that could predict patient-specific drug responses. However, there are inherent weaknesses in using only genetic and transcriptomic measurements as surrogates of drug response, particularly the absence of direct information about phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction. As a member of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, we have extended the molecular characterization of this cohort by collecting proteomic and phosphoproteomic measurements from a subset of these patient samples to evaluate the hypothesis that proteomic signatures can improve the ability to predict drug response in AML patients. In this work we describe our systematic, multi-omic approach to evaluate proteomic signatures of drug response and compare protein levels to other markers of drug response such as mutational patterns. We explore the nuances of this approach using two drugs that target key pathways activated in AML: quizartinib (FLT3) and trametinib (Ras/MEK), and show how patient-derived signatures can be interpreted biologically and validated in cell lines. In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrates strong promise for proteomics-based patient stratification to assess drug sensitivity in AML.</p>",

Proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and glycoproteomic analyses were used to characterize proteins and their modifications. In addition, whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, methylation, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) were performed on the same tissues to facilitate an integrated proteogenomic analysis and determine the impact of genomic alterations on protein expression, signaling pathways, and post-translational modifications. To ensure robust downstream analyses, tumor neoplastic cellularity was assessed via multiple orthogonal strategies using molecular features and verified via pathological estimation of tumor cellularity based on histological review. This integrated proteogenomic characterization of PDAC will serve as a valuable resource for the community, paving the way for early detection and identification of novel therapeutic targets.</p>",

Proteogenomic analyses of somatic copy number aberrations identified a resistance-associated 19q13.32-33 deletion where LIG1, POLD1 and XRCC1 are located. In orthogonal datasets, LIG1 (DNA ligase I involved in lagging strand synthesis) gene deletion and/or low mRNA expression were associated with lack of pathological complete response and poor prognosis in TNBC, as well as selective carboplatin-resistance in TNBC patient-derived xenograft models.

        "study_description": "<p>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) affects 20,000 patients in the US annually with a five-year survival rate of approximately 25%. One reason for the low survival rate is the high prevalence of clonal evolution that gives rise to heterogeneous sub-populations of leukemic cells with diverse mutation spectra, which eventually leads to disease relapse. This genetic heterogeneity drives the activation of complex signaling pathways that is reflected at the protein level. This diversity makes it difficult to treat AML with targeted therapy, requiring custom patient treatment protocols tailored to each individual\u2019s leukemia. Toward this end, the Beat AML research program prospectively collected genomic and transcriptomic data from over 1000 AML patients and carried out ex vivo drug sensitivity assays to identify genomic signatures that could predict patient-specific drug responses. However, there are inherent weaknesses in using only genetic and transcriptomic measurements as surrogates of drug response, particularly the absence of direct information about phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction. As a member of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, we have extended the molecular characterization of this cohort by collecting proteomic and phosphoproteomic measurements from a subset of these patient samples to evaluate the hypothesis that proteomic signatures can improve the ability to predict drug response in AML patients. In this work we describe our systematic, multi-omic approach to evaluate proteomic signatures of drug response and compare protein levels to other markers of drug response such as mutational patterns. We explore the nuances of this approach using two drugs that target key pathways activated in AML: quizartinib (FLT3) and trametinib (Ras/MEK), and show how patient-derived signatures can be interpreted biologically and validated in cell lines. In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrates strong promise for proteomics-based patient stratification to assess drug sensitivity in AML.</p>",

        "study_description": "<p>Our study details the stepwise evolution of gilteritinib resistance in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Early resistance is mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, which protects residual leukemia cells. Over time, leukemia cells evolve intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, or late resistance. We mechanistically define both early and late resistance by integrating whole-exome sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, metabolomics, proteomics, and pharmacologic approaches. Early resistant cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, grow more slowly, and are dependent upon Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Late resistant cells are characterized by expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones and continued metabolic reprogramming.

Integrated proteogenomic analyses revealed consistency and discordance among multi-omics, activation status of key signaling pathways, and liver-specific metabolic reprogramming in HBV-related HCC. Proteomic profiling identified three subgroups associated with clinical and molecular attributes including patient survival, tumor thrombus, genetic profile, and the liver-specific proteome. These proteomic subgroups have distinct features in metabolic reprogramming, microenvironment dysregulation, cell proliferation, and potential therapeutics. Two prognostic biomarkers, PYCR2 and ADH1A, related to proteomic subgrouping and involved in HCC metabolic reprogramming, were identified. CTNNB1 and TP53 mutation-associated signaling and metabolic profiles were revealed, among which mutated CTNNB1-associated ALDOA phosphorylation was validated to promote glycolysis and cell proliferation. Our study provides a valuable resource that significantly expands the knowledge of HBV-related HCC and may eventually benefit clinical practice.</p><p>Clinical Data is provided below.<br>Genomic Data for HCC tumors is available from the The National Omics Data Encyclopedia (NODE), part of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences <a href='https://www.biosino.org/node/project/detail/OEP000321' target='_blank'>here</a></p><p>This work was done under the auspices of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Science, Fudan University, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Clinical Proteomics Research (Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium [CPTAC]).

Early resistance is mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, which protects residual leukemia cells. Over time, leukemia cells evolve intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, or late resistance. We mechanistically define both early and late resistance by integrating whole-exome sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, metabolomics, proteomics, and pharmacologic approaches. Early resistant cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, grow more slowly, and are dependent upon Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Late resistant cells are characterized by expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones and continued metabolic reprogramming. Our model closely mirrors the timing and mutations of AML patients treated with gilteritinib.

Targeted quantitation of two peptides can predict antigen processing and presentation machinery (APM) activity and may inform patient selection for immunotherapy. Association analysis between MYC activity and metformin treatment in both tumors and cell lines suggests a potential role for metformin treatment in non-diabetic patients with elevated MYC activity. PIK3R1 in-frame indels are associated with elevated AKT phosphorylation and increased sensitivity to AKT inhibitors. CTNNB1 hotspot mutations are concentrated near phosphorylation sites mediating pS45 induced degradation of &#946;-catenin, which may render Wnt/FZD antagonists ineffective. Deep learning accurately predicts EC subtypes and mutations from histopathology images, which may be useful for rapid diagnosis. Overall, this study identified molecular and imaging markers that can be further investigated to guide patient stratification for improved precision treatment of EC.</p>",

We measured the proteome and phosphoproteome of 210 patients and combined them with transcriptomic measurements to identify four proteogenomic subtypes that complemented existing genetic subtypes. We used these subtypes to classify additional samples and map them to a \u2018landscape\u2019 that identified specific drug response patterns that predicted efficacious drug combinations. We then built a drug response prediction model to identify drugs that target distinct subtypes and validated our findings on cell lines representing various stages of quizartinib resistance.

Comparative analyses of paired primary-recurrent GBMs showed increased clonal diversity in recurrent tumors as a function of elapsed time since primary diagnosis and treatment-induced mutational and signaling signatures at recurrence. Additionally, across our entire cohort, independent analyses of proteomic and metabolomic changes associated with the trans effects of PTEN and TERT promoter mutations, when considered independently, showed a high correlation between the downstream effects of the two drivers. Glycoproteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed crosstalk of dual glycosylation (N352 and N603) and phosphorylation (Y316) on EGFR, but only observed in the context of EGFR amplification or activating mutations. IDH1 mutation was associated with activated RTK signaling and decreased hypoxia pathway activities, which was concordant with epigenetic and metabolic profiles. Protein-protein interaction and kinase/phosphatase-substrate analyses uncovered detailed signaling flowing from upstream drivers (e.g., EGFR, PDGFRA, and IDH) through a PTPN11 network hub to downstream effectors, including GAB1, IRS1, MAP3K5, and PTK2B. We also report recurrent mutations in PTPN11 and its downstream consequences. In summary, this study presents new biological insights regarding treatment impact on tumor evolution and clinical outcomes, shared downstream consequences of independent drivers, and the potential importance of members of PTPN11 signaling circuitry across high-grade gliomas.</p>",

We measured the proteome and phosphoproteome of 210 patients and combined them with transcriptomic measurements to identify four proteogenomic subtypes that complemented existing genetic subtypes. We used these subtypes to classify additional samples and map them to a \u2018landscape\u2019 that identified specific drug response patterns that predicted efficacious drug combinations. We then built a drug response prediction model to identify drugs that target distinct subtypes and validated our findings on cell lines representing various stages of quizartinib resistance.

        "study_description": "<p>Our study details the stepwise evolution of gilteritinib resistance in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Early resistance is mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, which protects residual leukemia cells. Over time, leukemia cells evolve intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, or late resistance. We mechanistically define both early and late resistance by integrating whole-exome sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, metabolomics, proteomics, and pharmacologic approaches. Early resistant cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, grow more slowly, and are dependent upon Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Late resistant cells are characterized by expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones and continued metabolic reprogramming. Our model closely mirrors the timing and mutations of AML patients treated with gilteritinib. Pharmacological inhibition of AURKB resensitizes both early resistant cell cultures and primary leukemia cells from gilteritinib-treated AML patients. These findings support a combinatorial strategy to target early resistant AML cells with AURKB inhibitors and gilteritinib before the expansion of pre-existing resistance mutations occurs.</p><p>Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Data Analysis is provided below for:<br>Gilteritinib Resistance<br>Quizartinib Resistance<br>Gilteritinib TimeCourse</p><p>Peptide Spectrum Matches (PSMs) and Summary Reports available are from the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP).</p><p>The whole exome sequencing (WES) datasets generated during this study are available at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA666471/' target='_blank'>PRJNA666471</a>).<br>\nCRISPR-Cas9 datasets generated during this study are available at NCBI GEO (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158717' target='_blank'>GSE158717</a>).<br>\nRNA-Sequencing data generated during this study is available at NCBI GEO (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE168583' target='_blank'>GSE168583</a>).</p>",

Toward understanding the underlying molecular alterations that drive PDAC oncogenesis, we conducted comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of 140 pancreatic cancers, 67 normal adjacent tissues, and 9 normal pancreatic ductal tissues. Proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and glycoproteomic analyses were used to characterize proteins and their modifications. In addition, whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, methylation, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) were performed on the same tissues to facilitate an integrated proteogenomic analysis and determine the impact of genomic alterations on protein expression, signaling pathways, and post-translational modifications. To ensure robust downstream analyses, tumor neoplastic cellularity was assessed via multiple orthogonal strategies using molecular features and verified via pathological estimation of tumor cellularity based on histological review.

        "study_description": "<p>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) affects 20,000 patients in the US annually with a five-year survival rate of approximately 25%. One reason for the low survival rate is the high prevalence of clonal evolution that gives rise to heterogeneous sub-populations of leukemic cells with diverse mutation spectra, which eventually leads to disease relapse. This genetic heterogeneity drives the activation of complex signaling pathways that is reflected at the protein level. This diversity makes it difficult to treat AML with targeted therapy, requiring custom patient treatment protocols tailored to each individual\u2019s leukemia. Toward this end, the Beat AML research program prospectively collected genomic and transcriptomic data from over 1000 AML patients and carried out ex vivo drug sensitivity assays to identify genomic signatures that could predict patient-specific drug responses. However, there are inherent weaknesses in using only genetic and transcriptomic measurements as surrogates of drug response, particularly the absence of direct information about phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction. As a member of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, we have extended the molecular characterization of this cohort by collecting proteomic and phosphoproteomic measurements from a subset of these patient samples to evaluate the hypothesis that proteomic signatures can improve the ability to predict drug response in AML patients. In this work we describe our systematic, multi-omic approach to evaluate proteomic signatures of drug response and compare protein levels to other markers of drug response such as mutational patterns. We explore the nuances of this approach using two drugs that target key pathways activated in AML: quizartinib (FLT3) and trametinib (Ras/MEK), and show how patient-derived signatures can be interpreted biologically and validated in cell lines. In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrates strong promise for proteomics-based patient stratification to assess drug sensitivity in AML.</p>",

Targeted quantitation of two peptides can predict antigen processing and presentation machinery (APM) activity and may inform patient selection for immunotherapy. Association analysis between MYC activity and metformin treatment in both tumors and cell lines suggests a potential role for metformin treatment in non-diabetic patients with elevated MYC activity. PIK3R1 in-frame indels are associated with elevated AKT phosphorylation and increased sensitivity to AKT inhibitors. CTNNB1 hotspot mutations are concentrated near phosphorylation sites mediating pS45 induced degradation of &#946;-catenin, which may render Wnt/FZD antagonists ineffective. Deep learning accurately predicts EC subtypes and mutations from histopathology images, which may be useful for rapid diagnosis. Overall, this study identified molecular and imaging markers that can be further investigated to guide patient stratification for improved precision treatment of EC.</p>",

Early resistance is mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, which protects residual leukemia cells. Over time, leukemia cells evolve intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, or late resistance. We mechanistically define both early and late resistance by integrating whole-exome sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, metabolomics, proteomics, and pharmacologic approaches. Early resistant cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, grow more slowly, and are dependent upon Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Late resistant cells are characterized by expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones and continued metabolic reprogramming. Our model closely mirrors the timing and mutations of AML patients treated with gilteritinib. Pharmacological inhibition of AURKB resensitizes both early resistant cell cultures and primary leukemia cells from gilteritinib-treated AML patients. These findings support a combinatorial strategy to target early resistant AML cells with AURKB inhibitors and gilteritinib before the expansion of pre-existing resistance mutations occurs.</p><p>Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Data Analysis is provided below for:<br>Gilteritinib Resistance<br>Quizartinib Resistance<br>Gilteritinib TimeCourse</p><p>Peptide Spectrum Matches (PSMs) and Summary Reports available are from the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP).</p><p>The whole exome sequencing (WES) datasets generated during this study are available at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA666471/' target='_blank'>PRJNA666471</a>).<br>\nCRISPR-Cas9 datasets generated during this study are available at NCBI GEO (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158717' target='_blank'>GSE158717</a>).<br>\nRNA-Sequencing data generated during this study is available at NCBI GEO (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE168583' target='_blank'>GSE168583</a>).</p>",

Somatic genome signature analysis reveals three subtypes including a transition-high subtype enriched with never-smokers, a transversion-high subtype enriched with current smokers, and a structurally-altered subtype enriched with former smokers, TP53 alterations, and genome-wide structural alterations. We show that within-tumor correlations of RNA and protein expression associate with tumor purity, grade, immune cell profiles, and expression subtype.  We detect and independently validate RNA and protein expression signatures predicting patient survival.  Among co-measured genes, more proteins than RNAs associate with patient survival.  Integrative analysis characterizes three expression subtypes with divergent mutations, proteomic regulatory networks, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Ultimately, this proteogenomic characterization provides a foundation for the development of molecularly-informed medicine in LUAD.",

To advance the understanding of HNSCC, the CPTAC program has performed a comprehensive integrated proteogenomic characterization of a 108 human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative HNSCC cohort.  Global proteome and phosphoproteome analysis from an optimized workflow for mass spectrometry of tissues using isobaric tags (TMT (tandem mass tags)-11) was used (Mertins et al., Nature Protocols 2018). Proteome and phosphoproteome data from the HNSCC discovery cohort is available below along with peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) and protein summary reports from the CPTAC common data analysis pipeline (CDAP).</p>",

To illuminate the molecular phenotype of this demographically distinct disease, a proteogenomics study is performed on a prospectively collected cohort in Taiwan, representing early stage non-smoking lung adenocarcinoma. The mutational profiles revealed age-dependent mutagenesis mechanisms characterized by high prevalence of APOBEC mutational signature in younger females. The study delineates the proteogenomic hallmarks of tumor progression and utilize unsupervised clustering to devise a proteomics-informed classification that distinguishes the clinical characteristics of early stage patients with EGFR mutations. Functional annotation of these molecular subtypes by protein network analysis highlights the cellular remodeling underpinning clinical trajectories, providing candidate biomarkers for patient stratification and opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

Comparative analyses of paired primary-recurrent GBMs showed increased clonal diversity in recurrent tumors as a function of elapsed time since primary diagnosis and treatment-induced mutational and signaling signatures at recurrence. Additionally, across our entire cohort, independent analyses of proteomic and metabolomic changes associated with the trans effects of PTEN and TERT promoter mutations, when considered independently, showed a high correlation between the downstream effects of the two drivers. Glycoproteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed crosstalk of dual glycosylation (N352 and N603) and phosphorylation (Y316) on EGFR, but only observed in the context of EGFR amplification or activating mutations. IDH1 mutation was associated with activated RTK signaling and decreased hypoxia pathway activities, which was concordant with epigenetic and metabolic profiles. Protein-protein interaction and kinase/phosphatase-substrate analyses uncovered detailed signaling flowing from upstream drivers (e.g., EGFR, PDGFRA, and IDH) through a PTPN11 network hub to downstream effectors, including GAB1, IRS1, MAP3K5, and PTK2B. We also report recurrent mutations in PTPN11 and its downstream consequences. In summary, this study presents new biological insights regarding treatment impact on tumor evolution and clinical outcomes, shared downstream consequences of independent drivers, and the potential importance of members of PTPN11 signaling circuitry across high-grade gliomas.</p>",

SOX2 is considered undruggable, but our analyses provide rationale for exploring chromatin modifiers such as LSD1 and EZH2 to target SOX2-overexpressing tumors. Our data support complex regulation of metabolic pathways by crosstalk between post-translational modifications including ubiquitylation. Numerous immune-related proteogenomic observations suggest directions for further investigation. Proteogenomic dissection of CDKN2A mutations argue for more nuanced assessment of RB1 protein expression and phosphorylation before declaring CDK4/6 inhibition unsuccessful.

We detect and independently validate RNA and protein expression signatures predicting patient survival.  Among co-measured genes, more proteins than RNAs associate with patient survival.

        "study_description": "<p>Our study details the stepwise evolution of gilteritinib resistance in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Early resistance is mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, which protects residual leukemia cells. Over time, leukemia cells evolve intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, or late resistance. We mechanistically define both early and late resistance by integrating whole-exome sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, metabolomics, proteomics, and pharmacologic approaches. Early resistant cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, grow more slowly, and are dependent upon Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Late resistant cells are characterized by expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones and continued metabolic reprogramming. Our model closely mirrors the timing and mutations of AML patients treated with gilteritinib. Pharmacological inhibition of AURKB resensitizes both early resistant cell cultures and primary leukemia cells from gilteritinib-treated AML patients. These findings support a combinatorial strategy to target early resistant AML cells with AURKB inhibitors and gilteritinib before the expansion of pre-existing resistance mutations occurs.</p><p>Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Data Analysis is provided below for:<br>Gilteritinib Resistance<br>Quizartinib Resistance<br>Gilteritinib TimeCourse</p><p>Peptide Spectrum Matches (PSMs) and Summary Reports available are from the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP).</p><p>The whole exome sequencing (WES) datasets generated during this study are available at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA666471/' target='_blank'>PRJNA666471</a>).<br>\nCRISPR-Cas9 datasets generated during this study are available at NCBI GEO (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158717' target='_blank'>GSE158717</a>).<br>\nRNA-Sequencing data generated during this study is available at NCBI GEO (Accession Code - <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE168583' target='_blank'>GSE168583</a>).</p>",

Further refinement of differential diagnosis biomarkers under biopsy setting, prognostic markers for early aggressive disease detection and treatments to complement immunotherapy are current clinical needs. Multi-omics analyses of 48 non-ccRCC with 103 ccRCCs revealed proteogenomic, phosphorylation, glycosylation and metabolic aberrations in RCC subtypes and in non-ccRCC tumors with genome instability, a feature associated with poor survival. Expression of PYCR1, DPYSL3, IKBIP, and FABP6 genes is highly associated with GI and comprises a four-gene non-ccRCC prognostic signature. Integration of single cell and bulk transcriptome data predicted diverse cells-of-origin and clarified RCC subtype-specific proteogenomic signatures. Addition of biomarkers identified and validated here, including MAPRE3 and GPNMB (chromophobe RCC) and PIGR and SOSTDC1 (papillary RCC), will enhance current biomarker panels. In summary, this non-ccRCC proteogenomic data resource expands diagnostic/ prognostic markers, therapeutic targets and aids future pan-RCC analyses.</p><p><i>Note: The proteomic analyses were conducted on 48 non-ccRCC and 103 ccRCC tumors.

        "study_description": "<p>To delineate the multi-scale regulatory interactions governing glioblastoma (GBM) development and evolution (recurrence and clinical outcomes), we characterized 228 human GBM tumors (including 28 at recurrence) using 15 proteogenomic and metabolomic platforms. Comparative analyses of paired primary-recurrent GBMs showed increased clonal diversity in recurrent tumors as a function of elapsed time since primary diagnosis and treatment-induced mutational and signaling signatures at recurrence. Additionally, across our entire cohort, independent analyses of proteomic and metabolomic changes associated with the trans effects of PTEN and TERT promoter mutations, when considered independently, showed a high correlation between the downstream effects of the two drivers. Glycoproteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed crosstalk of dual glycosylation (N352 and N603) and phosphorylation (Y316) on EGFR, but only observed in the context of EGFR amplification or activating mutations. IDH1 mutation was associated with activated RTK signaling and decreased hypoxia pathway activities, which was concordant with epigenetic and metabolic profiles. Protein-protein interaction and kinase/phosphatase-substrate analyses uncovered detailed signaling flowing from upstream drivers (e.g., EGFR, PDGFRA, and IDH) through a PTPN11 network hub to downstream effectors, including GAB1, IRS1, MAP3K5, and PTK2B. We also report recurrent mutations in PTPN11 and its downstream consequences. In summary, this study presents new biological insights regarding treatment impact on tumor evolution and clinical outcomes, shared downstream consequences of independent drivers, and the potential importance of members of PTPN11 signaling circuitry across high-grade gliomas.</p>",

Glycoproteome experiments identified and quantified sites of N-linked glycosylation using a Solid-Phase Extraction of Glycosite-containing peptides (SPEG) approach (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12754519/' target='_blank'>Zhang et al., 2003</a>), as well as identification of the glycans occupying those N-linked sites, using intact glycopeptides (IGPs) analysis (<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4872599/' target='_blank'>Sun et al., 2016</a>). These data extend the observations published in the CPTAC program study of ovarian cancer tumors from the TCGA collection by <a href='https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/study-summary/S026' target='_blank'>H. Zhang et al., (Cell 2016)</a> and lay the foundation for further proteogenomic stratification of ovarian tumors.</p><p>Data included here are from investigators at two Proteome Characterization Centers (PCCs), Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Both PCCs used TMT10plex isobaric labeling quantification for global proteomic profiling. PNNL also contributed phosphoproteomic assessment for each TMT10plex. All raw data files (level 1 data) have been run through the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP) to produce peptide spectrum match (PSM) reports (level 2 data). Protein summary reports (level 3 data) are included for the phosphoproteome data and for proteome analyses from each PCC.</p>",

        "study_description": "<p>We performed the first proteogenomic characterization of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using paired tumor and adjacent liver tissues from 159 patients. Integrated proteogenomic analyses revealed consistency and discordance among multi-omics, activation status of key signaling pathways, and liver-specific metabolic reprogramming in HBV-related HCC. Proteomic profiling identified three subgroups associated with clinical and molecular attributes including patient survival, tumor thrombus, genetic profile, and the liver-specific proteome. These proteomic subgroups have distinct features in metabolic reprogramming, microenvironment dysregulation, cell proliferation, and potential therapeutics. Two prognostic biomarkers, PYCR2 and ADH1A, related to proteomic subgrouping and involved in HCC metabolic reprogramming, were identified. CTNNB1 and TP53 mutation-associated signaling and metabolic profiles were revealed, among which mutated CTNNB1-associated ALDOA phosphorylation was validated to promote glycolysis and cell proliferation. Our study provides a valuable resource that significantly expands the knowledge of HBV-related HCC and may eventually benefit clinical practice.</p><p>Clinical Data is provided below.<br>Genomic Data for HCC tumors is available from the The National Omics Data Encyclopedia (NODE), part of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences <a href='https://www.biosino.org/node/project/detail/OEP000321' target='_blank'>here</a></p><p>This work was done under the auspices of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Science, Fudan University, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Clinical Proteomics Research (Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium [CPTAC]).
