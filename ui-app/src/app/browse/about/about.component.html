            The NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) aims to create a scalable infrastructure that 
            provides secure access to many different data types across scientific domains, allowing users 
            to analyze, share, and store results, leveraging the storage and elastic compute of the cloud. 
            As a node in this CRDC ecosystem, the Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) is a pilot project to democratize 
            access to cancer-related proteomic datasets as well as to provide sustainable computational support 
            to the cancer research community.

            Originally started as a design project for the base year (2017-2018), our team quickly realized that a 
            <b>Minimally Viable Product (MVP) </b> with a small subset of fully functioning features may be more 
            beneficial to the research community at an earlier stage. We hope that the MVP will serve as an 
            effective feedback mechanism for the user community and drive the future development of features 
            and capabilities of the final product.
        <br>
        <h4>NCI Proteomic Data Portal MVP Alpha Program</h4>
        We are inviting a select group of community members to alpha test the MVP and provide feedback to guide the future development of this product. 
        <h4>Features of the MVP:</h4>
        <h4><em>Extensible data model </em></h4>
        PDC is based on a Data Model that organizes of all (meta)data ingested through data submission and 
        generated by PDC data harmonization. The data model is designed to maintain data and metadata 
        consistency, integrity, and availability to the users and also all the applications in the CRDC 
        ecosystem.

        <h4><em>Public data portal</em></h4>
        The PDC Data Portal provides a platform for efficiently querying, visualizing and downloading high quality, curated and harmonized proteomic datasets.
        <br>
        <h4><em>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for programmatic access </em></h4>
        The PDC API allows for efficient data access by enabling the retrieval of multiple, nested resources 
        within a single request. The PDC APIs drive the user interface (UI) of the PDC data portal and provides 
        additional functionality for programmatic access than the data portal.
        <br>
        <h4><em>Data Submission portal</em></h4>
        The PDC provides workspaces for authorized users to submit their data from NCI mandated programs 
        for public release or upload their data prior to release to be shared with collaborators.
        <br>For the MVP, the workspace serves only as a submission portal and the ability to run data analysis pipelines from the workspace will be added as a feature in future.  

        <h4><em>Secure login</em></h4>
        The PDC data portal is open access (no login required); however the submission portal is secured through an authentication (Google OAuth, NIH Login and NIH eRA Commons) and authorization (by PDC Admin and NCI) process.

        <h4><em>Initial dataset </em></h4>
        The data from the Phase II of the NCI Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) is the initial dataset available from the PDC. Learn more about CPTAC Data – <a href="https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptacPublic/">https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptacPublic/</a>

        <h4><em>Data Download</em></h4>
        The PDC MVP platform only allows download of the manifest files. For download of the actual data, please go to CPTAC Data Portal – <a href="https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptacPublic/">https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptacPublic/</a>
        <br>
        Note:<br>
        All of the features of the MVP are work in progress. We would like to hear the feedback from the user community so we continue to improve and build a resource that meets and exceeds community needs.
