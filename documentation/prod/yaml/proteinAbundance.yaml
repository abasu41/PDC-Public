properties:
  distinct_peptide:
    description: Number of distinct peptide sequences associated with the gene in
      acquisitions from a specific analytical sample
    required: 'False'
    type: number
  log_ratio:
    description: Average log-ratio of sample reporter-ion to common reference of peptide
      ions associated with the gene in acquisitions from a specific biological sample.
    required: 'False'
    type: number
  plex_name:
    description: For label-free workflows, the plex name is the aliquot (biological
      sample) identifier. For labelled workflows (iTRAQ, TMT), the plex name indicates
      the aliquot (biological sample) identifiers and any common reference aliquot
      (sample) identifier, separated by colons, in reporter ion order. Biological
      replicates, if any, are indicated by a trailing .1, .2, etc. on the aliquot
      identifier.
    required: 'False'
    type: number
  precursor_area:
    description: Total precursor area of peptide ions associated with the gene in
      acquisitions from a specific biological sample.
    required: 'False'
    type: number
  spectral_count:
    description: Number of spectra matched to peptides associated with the gene in
      acquisitions from a specific analytical sample
    required: 'False'
    type: number
  unshared_log_ratio:
    description: Average log-ratio of sample reporter-ion to common reference of peptide
      ions of unshared peptides only associated with the gene in acquisitions from
      a specific biological sample.
    required: 'False'
    type: number
  unshared_peptide:
    description: Number of unshared peptide sequences associated with the gene in
      acquisitions from a specific analytical sample
    required: 'False'
    type: number
