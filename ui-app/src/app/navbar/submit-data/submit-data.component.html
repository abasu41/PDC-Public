                    <p><b>Note: Before you begin the submission, we strongly recommend you use the PDC submission template to collect the information required for a successful submission.</b></p>
              <p>Now you are ready to begin the submission process. <b>You need to follow the steps in the order given in the Submission Overview (image) at the top of this document to avoid duplicating steps</b></p>
                    <p>The submission process involves the following major activities,</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Creating an <b>instrument</b> to upload raw data</li>
                      <li>Create a <b>project</b> under which to group the raw data into a <b>Study</b> that was generated using a specific experimental <b>protocol</b></li>
                      <li>Upload biospecimen and clinical metadata for the samples used in the Studies</li>
                      <li>Upload any additional supplementary files</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Create an instrument:</b><br><br><p>An instrument is a representation of the mass spectrometer from your lab. Go to create, click instrument, and enter the relevant information about the mass spectrometer used to collect the data. If you are a program member, you will receive an email once approved by the PDC admin or the program lead (PI).</p><br><br>
                            <div style="text-align:center"><img mat-card-image style="align-content: center" src="assets/createInstrument.png" alt="Login to PDC"></div>
                        <br>
                        <p>Note: You must be added as an assigned instrument operator to upload data to an instrument unless you are the creator of that instrument.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Upload raw files:</b><br><br><p>Click upload, and in the dialog requesting information, select the instrument you previously created. You can upload directly from your local computer or from the cloud (AWS S3 is supported) if your files are on S3 already.</p><br><br>
                                <div style="text-align:center"><img mat-card-image style="align-content: center" src="assets/updateRawfiles.png" alt="Login to PDC"></div>
                            <p>Note: The PDC Workspace accepts files with the “.raw”, “.d”; “.wiff”; “.wiff.scan”; “.wiff.mtd”; “.dat”; “.mis”. These files are produced directly on the mass spectrometer acquisition computer and are typically in proprietary formats.</p>
                            <p>Tip: You may create a separate instrument for each study that you would like to create, even if all those files are generated from the same mass spectrometer. This is not required, but may help to organize and separate your files, facilitating study creation.</p>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><b>Create a Project:</b><br><br>
                            <p><b>Before you can create a Study or add your Protocol, you first need to create a Project.</b></p>
                            <p>Click Create->Project to open the wizard. Next, give your Project a name, select a Program and area of Research. You may also add collaborators to your project using the Sharing tab.</p><br><br>

                        <li><b>Create a Study:</b><br><br>
                            <p>In the PDC workspace, a study is a group of <b>instrument</b> raw files that are generated using a specific experimental <b>protocol</b>, with a well-annotated experimental design (sample to file mapping) that can be analyzed through a single bioinformatics pipeline.</p>
                            <p> To create the study, click Create->Study to launch the wizard. In the wizard, for steps requiring you to enter data in tabular form for the sample/aliquot to file mapping, you may copy and paste from the Experimental Run Metadata sheet from the PDC submission template you prepared.  If you are unable to complete your study, you can click ‘Save as Draft’ to resume later.</p><br><br>

                            <p>To load the Clinical and Biospecimen data, save the Case Matrix, Case, Demographics, Diagnosis, Exposure, Family History, Treatment, Follow-Up, Sample, and Aliquot worksheets as TSV files from the PDC Submission template you prepared.</p>
                            <p>Note: Clinical and biospecimen metadata should be submitted for all the aliquots (their parent samples and cases) that are entered in the Study creation step.</p>
                            <p>All 10 files are required for upload, but if you have no data for the Exposure, Family History, Treatment, and Follow-Up entities you may include empty files containing only the column headers. Place all 10 TSV files in a new folder on your local computer. In the workspace click “Upload” then under Metadata click “Direct Upload.”</p>
                            <br><br><div style="text-align:center; margin-left: 15px"><img mat-card-image style="align-content: center" src="assets/uploadMetadata-1.png" alt="Upload Metadata"></div>
                            <br><p>A popup wizard to upload the metadata will appear.

                            <p>You may also upload additional supplementary files (non-raw files), such as processed outputs from your own data analysis pipeline, SOPs, clinical data, etc.  You can select the appropriate data category for the files you wish upload -  ‘Alternative Processing Pipeline’, ‘Other Metadata’ and ‘Supplementary Data’.</p>
                            <p>Once you complete the Study creation, you may proceed to upload the supplementary files associated with the study.  We recommend you contact the PDC team to validate your study on Workspace before you begin uploading the non-raw files.</p>
                            <p>To begin uploading any of these types of files, select “Direct Upload” under the ‘Non-Raw Files’ tab in the ‘Upload’ dropdown.</p>

                            <p>The Data Source ‘Submitter’ will be automatically filled in. The other option, CDAP, is used by the PDC team to handle the upload of files produced by the “Common Data Analysis Pipeline.” Choose the data category you wish to upload from the ‘Data Category’ dropdown. Note that you will <b>only</b> be able to upload files with extensions belonging to that category. You may choose to upload a directory of files simultaneously, and file extensions that do not match the selected category will be automatically removed. However, note that some data categories have overlapping file extensions. You may wish to organize your files by data category prior to uploading.</p>
