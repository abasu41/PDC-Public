                    <p>Now you are ready to begin the submission process.</p>
                    <p>If you have not done so already, you should first request program membership or creation. Next, you can either create a project or an instrument. These steps have no prerequisites other than belonging to a program with mass spectrometers. You need to follow the steps in the order given in the Submission Overview at the top of this document to avoid duplicating steps. Registering an instrument will let you upload raw files from that instrument, after it has been approved by the PI. Once you have created a project and have uploaded raw data to the Workspace cloud, you should next create the Protocol used for your Study.</p>
                    <p>Finally, you can create Studies (experiments) and organize them into your created Projects. You can't create a study (experiment) without linking the study to a Project.</p>
                    <p>A Study is a group of instrument raw files that are acquired using a specific experimental Protocol.  Study metadata (e.g., TMT channel to sample mappings) and well-annotated study and experimental design (e.g., sample to file mappings) are also combined to create a Study.  A Study is typically analyzed through a single bioinformatics pipeline.</p>
                    <p>The PDC Workspace accepts files with the ".raw", ".d"; ".wiff"; ".wiff.scan"; ".wiff.mtd"; ".dat"; ".mis". These files are produced directly on the mass spectrometer acquisition computer and are typically in proprietary formats.</p>
                    <p>You must be an assigned instrument operator to upload data to an instrument.  If you are not, you must first be added as an Operator to the instrument.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Create an instrument:</b><br><br><p>An instrument is an instance of the mass spectrometer from your lab. Go to create, click instrument, and enter the relevant information about the mass spectrometer from your lab. If you are a program member, you will receive an email once approved by PDC admin or the program lead (PI).</p><br><br>

                        <br></li>
                        <li><b>Upload raw files:</b><br><br><p>Click upload, and in the dialog requesting information, select the instrument you previously created. You can upload directly from your local computer or from the cloud - AWS S3.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Tip: You may create a separate instrument for each study that you would like to create, even if all of those files are generated from the same mass spectrometer. </p>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><b>Create a Project:</b><br><br>
                            <p>Before you can create a Study or add your Protocol, you first need to create a Project.  Click Create->Project to open the wizard.  Next, give your Project a name, select a Program and area of Research.  You may also add collaborators to your project using the Sharing tab.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Next you will add the Protocol metadata used in your Study.  Click Create->Protocol to open the wizard. Only metadata with * are required. If you are unable to complete your protocol at the moment, you can click 'Save as Draft'.</p><br><br>

                            <br><p>You can later locate your protocol draft by locating 'View Type' on the left navigation panel. Click "My" and under 'Data Type' click "Protocol drafts". Locate your protocol name and click the vertical dots in front of your protocol name for a menu to appear.</p>

                        <li><b>Create a Study:</b><br><br>
                            <p>Finally, a Study can be created, linking your files to a Protocol, Project, and Program.  In the PDC workspace, a study is a group of instrument raw files that are generated using a specific experimental protocol, with well annotated experimental design (sample to file mapping) that can be analyzed through a single bioinformatics pipeline.</p>
                            <p>In order to create a study, you must have already connected the raw files with the Protocol and added additional metadata data about the experimental design. To create the Study, click Create->Study to launch the wizard. In the wizard, for steps requiring you to enter data in tabular form, you may copy-and-paste from spreadsheets. If you are unable to complete your study at the moment, you can click 'Save as Draft'.</p><br><br>

                            <p>In order to load the Clinical and Biospecimen data, save the Case Matrix, Case, Demographics, Diagnosis, Sample, Aliquot, Exposure, Follow-Up, Family History and Treatment worksheets from the submission template in separate TSV files. If there is no data for Exposure, Follow-Up, Family History and/or Treatment, you must upload empty files with only the column headers filled out. Place all 10 TSV files in a new folder on your local computer. In the workspace click 'Upload' then under Metadata click 'Direct Upload'. </p>

Next, click 'Select Program' to select the program the metadata belongs to and 'Select Project' to choose the project your metadata is associated to.

The other option, CDAP, is used by the PDC team to handle the upload of files produced by the "Common Data Analysis Pipeline". Choose the data category you wish to upload from the 'Data Category' dropdown. Note that you will only be able to upload files with extensions belonging to that category. You may choose to upload a directory of files simultaneously, and file extensions that do not match the selected category will be automatically removed.
